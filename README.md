> "The best way to get a project done faster is to start sooner." — Jim Highsmith

I’m a Fullstack Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience, a passion for software architecture, and an eye for elegant, scalable solutions. From legacy systems to bleeding-edge stacks, I’ve walked the whole path — and still love the journey.

I craft backend logic with **Java Spring Boot**, shape UI magic with **React**, orchestrate systems in **Node.js**, and store it all with **SQL/MySQL**. I’ve worked on mission-critical apps, mentored teams, and even donated mainframe power to science (yes, that happened).
